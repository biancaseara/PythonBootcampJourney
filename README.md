## Resources

Here are some external resources that I found helpful during my Python learning journey:

- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): The official documentation for the Python programming language.
- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com): An interactive tool for visualizing Python code and understanding how it's executed. Super helpful for debugging your code.
