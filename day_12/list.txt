Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard':
easy = You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
hard = You have 5 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 
Too low or Too high.
Guess again.
right answer = You got it! The answer is x.
wrong answer = You've run out of guesses, you lose.
